          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The head element contains metadata that is invisible to users.</li>
          <li>The body element is considered a semantic element.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS code has a selector and a declaration block.</li>
          <li>The selector is the tag in front of the brackets, and can be either an element name or a class attribute.</li>
          <li>A class attribute can be applied to select elements in HTML.</li>
          <li>The declaration block is comprised of properties and values (e.g. color: blue;).</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and Internal CSS are embedded in an HTML file, useful for quick and permanent changes.</li>
          <li>External CSS is preferable, as it keeps all style choices in one place where they are easily modifiable.</li>
          <li>To use External CSS, you have to link the CSS file in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>You can add specific colors by using their hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: stages all files after making changes, so they are recorded and added to the next commit</li>
          <li>git commit -m "commit name": saves commit to working branch</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pull source code to ensure changes and commits are up to date</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>You can use brackets to make variables into arrays, so that several items can be counted as the same variable.</li>
          <li>Items in an array are numbered, beginning with '0'.</li>
          <li>Variables can be numbers, objects, or 'strings'.</li>
          <li>A 'string' is some amount of text contained within '' or "" that will be read as a word or phrase.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A Conditional Statement allows you to code different outcomes for different variables.</li>
          <li>Conditional Statements are coded by using 'if', 'else if', and 'else' to define variables and their outcomes.</li>
          <li>'for' Loops are used to continue running a code block over and over until a set parameter has been reached.</li>
          <li>A 'for' Loop contains three statements: a starting point for the loop, the condiditon that must be met for the code to stop repeating, and what allows the loop to iterate over each item.</li>
          <li>By using /* and */ before and after a code block, you can "comment it out" and put in on hold.</li>
          <li>You can use functions to reuse code blocks and run them selectively instead of automatically.</li>
          <li>To do this, you must first define a function using the keyword 'function'.</li>
          <li>Then, you must call the function later in the code. Note: functions must be followed by parentheses.</li>
